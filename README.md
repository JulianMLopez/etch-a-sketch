# Etch-A-Sketch
Etch-A-Sketch is a digital version of a toy that many of us loved as kids.

In my version of Etch-A-Sketch, you can easily select whichever color you want or choose between multiple preset color values.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Challenges
In this project, one of the main challenges I faced was setting up the grayscale option to properly work over other colors. Originally, if a user had selected the grayscale option and there was already a color in the div that was trying to be painted, the output would just provide an entirely black box as opposed to the lighter gray that was expected.

In the future, I hope to revist this project and add to my UI elements as I feel it is somewhat plain looking. I would also like to try to eventually get this project to work on mobile devices.
